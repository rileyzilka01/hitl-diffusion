Make sure im using the correct data everywhere: point cloud, joint position, ee position, ee orientation
Shouldnt need to change the dicts anywhere can just use whats there
 - action would be ee orientation, the rest would be their own inputs
 - agent_state is the ee position and joint position combined
 - point_cloud is the point cloud
